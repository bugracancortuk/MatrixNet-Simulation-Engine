# MatrixNet-Simulation-Engine
> MatrixNet is a Java engine for simulating network topologies and graph vulnerabilities. It features Dijkstra-style pathfinding with bandwidth/latency constraints, and structural analysis to identify critical failure points like Articulation Points and Bridges through command-driven breach simulations.
